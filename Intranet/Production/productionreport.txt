What is a daily production report?

The Daily Production Report (often a two-sided page) is filled out by a member of the production, and contains key information about the shoot day.  It summarizes:

    Who was on set and for how long
    Payroll obligations for crew
    Scenes you shot and how much media you used to do it
    New release forms
    Unexpected expenses
    Delays or accidents on set
